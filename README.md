Project: DriverPass System
Author: Alondra Paulino Santos

The DriverPass project was developed for a client who wanted to improve how students prepare for DMV driving exams. The company identified that over 65% of students fail their tests on their first try, so the goal was to build a system that combines online study materials, realistic practice exams, and on-the-road driving instruction. DriverPass needed a web-based platform that could securely manage customers, instructors, and administrators while allowing students to learn and track progress from anywhere. The system also had to make operations easier for staff by organizing lessons, scheduling, and payments through one secure interface.

Throughout these projects, I worked on both the Business Requirements Document (Project One) and the System Design Document (Project Two) to define, design, and support the development of the DriverPass system. One of the areas I did particularly well was developing the user interface and scheduling features. I clearly defined how different user roles—students, instructors, secretaries, and administrators—would interact with the platform and perform their tasks. I also created a detailed Gantt chart that outlined each phase of the project, helping visualize time allocation and dependencies between development stages. These areas showed my ability to think about user experience, system flow, and time management, all of which are critical for a successful system design.

If I could choose one area to revise or improve, it would be how I handled the functional and nonfunctional requirements in Project One. I struggled to fully separate the two categories and missed some key details that should have been included under technical requirements. For example, I didn’t specify which operating systems, browsers, or database versions the system would support. I could also have provided more clarity on performance expectations and compatibility constraints. These details are important for ensuring consistency between design and implementation. Additionally, in Project Two, I wish I had more time to analyze the logic and accuracy of my UML diagrams, especially to make sure that relationships, data flow, and sequence logic aligned perfectly across all models. With more time, I would refine both the documentation and diagram logic to create a more complete and technically precise system design.

When designing the system, interpreting the user’s needs was one of the most important steps. I focused on understanding how different roles, students, instructors, secretaries, and administrators, would use the platform every day. Each role required unique access levels and actions. For instance, students needed to purchase packages and take practice exams, while instructors needed to view schedules and log lesson feedback. Translating those needs into UML diagrams was how I ensured the design matched real-world workflows. The use case diagram showed how users interact with the system, the activity diagrams demonstrated step-by-step processes (like scheduling lessons or taking exams), the sequence diagram explained how data moves between users and the system, and the class diagram organized how data is stored and accessed. Designing from the user’s perspective ensured that the system remained practical, secure, and scalable.

The technical requirements also played a major role in supporting the final system design. DriverPass was designed as a cloud-hosted web application using Java Spring Boot with a PostgreSQL or MySQL database, ensuring reliability and easy maintenance. Security was a top priority; the system uses TLS 1.3 encryption, AES-256 data protection, and bcrypt hashing for passwords. It also integrates with DMV systems via secure APIs, ensuring that study materials and testing policies always stay up to date. Hosting the system on AWS or Azure with automated backups and performance monitoring ensures high uptime and smooth scalability as the business grows.

In approaching system design, I used a structured, analytical process similar to what professional software engineers follow: identify the problem, analyze requirements, design the architecture, and document everything clearly for development. If I were to design a new system in the future, I would apply the same approach but add even more focus on prototyping and iterative design, using early feedback from users to refine functionality before full development. I would also use additional modeling techniques, like sequence refinements or interface mockups, to help communicate design ideas clearly across teams.

Overall, the DriverPass projects demonstrate my ability to perform systems analysis and design, from gathering client requirements to modeling and documenting a complete, secure system. These artifacts highlight my understanding of business goals, user needs, and technical design. For future employers, I would showcase these documents to demonstrate my skills in translating client requirements into working system specifications, developing secure and scalable architectures, and applying professional documentation practices that are essential in real-world software engineering. The DriverPass system represents the kind of thoughtful, user-focused design that improves both business efficiency and customer success, which is exactly the kind of value I aim to bring to any software project I work on.
